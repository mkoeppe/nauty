Disclaimer:
 This program is not part of Debian, because the license discriminates
 against forbids selling for profit fields of endeavour, which violates
 the Debian Free Software Guidelines part 1 and 6 respectively
 (see www.debian.org/social_contract ). Neither of these conditions
 impedes the autobuilding of the package.
Comment:
 The upstream source tarball is repacked to drop off some weight
 by cleaning up material either generated or upgraded by autotools.
