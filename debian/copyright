Disclaimer: This program is not part of Debian, because the license
 discriminates against forbids selling for profit fields of endeavour,
 which violates the Debian Free Software Guidelines part 1 and 6
 respectively (see http://www.debian.org/social_contract).  Neither of
 these conditions impedes the autobuilding of the package.
