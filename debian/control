Description: tool to compute graph automorphisms and canonical labellings
 nauty (no automorphisms, yes?) is a set of procedures for determining
 the automor- phism group of a vertex-coloured graph. It provides this
 information in the form of a set of generators, the size of the
 group, and the orbits of the group. It is also able to produce a
 canonically-labelled isomorph of the graph, to assist in isomorphism
 testing.  This package provides the main command line tool dreadnaut,
 and some utilities ('gtools').  A C API is also available.
